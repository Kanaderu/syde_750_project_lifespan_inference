Andreas St√∂ckel SYDE 750 Project Code Repository
================================================

To recreate all figures in the report, just run "make" in this directory. To
parallelise the experiments, use "make -j4". All data can be found in the "out"
folder. This can take a while.

Following a list of Python scripts in this directory and their purpose.

Actual implementation
---------------------

basis_functions.py
    Contains the basis function definitions and the mechanism for automatically
    calculating the spread of the functions. Plots the basis function related
    figures in the report.

hmd_data.py
    Loads data from the Human Mortality Database project and returns a
    probability distribution object. Provides code for generating a
    deterministic probability distribution sampling function.

optimal_prediction.py
    Uses the Human Mortality Database data to optimally solve the Bayesian
    inference for the lifespan prediction task. Plots the corresponding plots
    in the report.

net_probability_distribution.py
    Defines the probability distribution network as a Nengo model.

net_lifespan_inference.py
    Defines the overall lifespan inference network as a Nengo model.

Plotting and analysis (here be dragons)
---------------------------------------

analyse_net_probability_distribution.py
    Builds the network used for the analysis of the probability distribution
    network. Plots the corresponding graphs found in the report.

analyse_net_probability_distribution_err.py
    Plots some more stuff from output files generated by
    analyse_net_probability_distribution.py.

analyse_net_lifespan_inference.py
    Performs the experiments on the lifespan inference network shown in the
    report. Plots the corresponing graphs found in the report.

Nengo GUI boilerplate code
--------------------------

gui_analyse_net_probability_distribution.py
    Load into Nengo GUI to toy around with the probability distribution network
    used in the analysis.

gui_analyse_net_lifespan_inference.py
    Can be used to laod the experiment analysing the lifespan inference network
    into Nengo GUI.
